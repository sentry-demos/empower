# Vlad said--
# i just checked the file. the test_utils.py is purely a test file, 
# just assertions and tests, so in theory it shouldn't be counted 
# towards the overall coverage of the repo or "production code". 
# i'm not sure why some tools include the tests as part of the coverage report, 
# but it can be mitigated by excluding them via codecov.yaml or --source setting 
# in the pytest, but the issue is that the test directory is also under the 
# /src/  so it looks like it is instrumenting the code for all the python files 
# in that location. this is not a big deal, but in case anyone asks this is why 
# it is showing up.
