# Angular Production Build Script
# This script builds the Angular application for production deployment
# It handles environment variable substitution and creates optimized bundles
#
# What this script does:
# 1. Sets up environment variables for the build
# 2. Cleans previous build artifacts
# 3. Installs dependencies if needed
# 4. Builds the Angular application with production optimizations
# 5. Processes source maps for Sentry error monitoring
# 6. Verifies the build output
#
# Usage:
#   ./build.sh                    # Build with default environment
#   RELEASE=v1.2.3 ./build.sh    # Build with specific release version
#   ENVIRONMENT=staging ./build.sh # Build for specific environment

set -e  # Exit immediately if any command fails
