      <p>
        Empower Plant is an IoT company determined to keep house plants
        happy. After reading Michael Pollan's 2013 New Yorker article ("The
        Intelligent Plant"), the wife-and-wife founding team invested their
        life savings in measuring and improving the emotional state of their
        leafy housemates. Seven years later, the company's grown from its
        humble roots in the couples' backyard greenhouse (converted from a
        garage) into a Series C-funded San Francisco startup and the world's
        most accurate plant mood measurer ("a must-have for any responsible
        plant parent," according to Plant Parenthood Magazine). Their
        original state-of-the-art product is a technological marvel built
        with a plant-first mindset, and they now offer a range of
        plant-centric options.

        Today, the company employs 170 people (and 852 plants) in San
        Francisco, New York City, Denver, and Kiev.
