# Must be run from inside project dir (e.g. './react/')
#
# There are two modes in which this script can be run. Both will create a temporary
# .env file in current directory by copying env-config/*.env, augment it with RELEASE
# (if not already set in env-config) and validate it using 'validate_env.list'.
#
# In the first mode (called from deploy.sh with 1 arg) it won't do anything else.
# Example:
#   ../env.sh production
#
# In the second mode (standalone), when given more than one arg, it will additionally
# run 2nd arg and the rest as command. Once the command exits it will clean up .env.
# Example:
#   ../env.sh local npm start
