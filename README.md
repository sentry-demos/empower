## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

# Laravel 12.x Demo Application

This is a modernized e-commerce demo application built with Laravel 12.x, part of the empower multi-framework demonstration repository.

## üöÄ Project Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation Setup ‚úÖ 
- [x] Laravel 12.x installation
- [x] Dependencies (Sentry, CORS)  
- [x] Google App Engine configuration
- [x] Basic middleware setup

#### Phase 2: Database & Models ‚úÖ
- [x] Create migrations for products, reviews, inventory
- [x] Build Eloquent models with relationships
- [x] Set up model factories and seeders

#### Phase 3: TDD Implementation ‚úÖ
- [x] **RED Phase**: 39 failing tests written
- [x] **GREEN Phase**: All tests passing (39 tests, 81 assertions)
- [x] Business logic extracted from Laravel 8.x routes
- [x] Controllers implemented with dependency injection
- [x] API routes configured

### üìä Test Coverage Status
```
‚úÖ Unit Tests: 34 passing
  - ProductTest: 10 tests (model behavior)
  - InventoryTest: 15 tests (stock management)  
  - OrderServiceTest: 5 tests (business logic)

‚úÖ Feature Tests: 7 passing
  - ProductApiTest: 7 tests (API endpoints)

Total: 39 PASSING tests with 81 assertions
```

### üîÑ Current Phase: REFACTOR (Optional)
- [ ] Code optimization while maintaining green tests
- [ ] Performance improvements
- [ ] Code documentation updates

### üìã Remaining Phases

#### Phase 4: Deployment & Production
- [ ] Database seeding with real data
- [ ] Google App Engine deployment testing
- [ ] Environment configuration
- [ ] Performance monitoring setup

#### Phase 5: Documentation & Cleanup
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Deployment guide
- [ ] Replace old Laravel 8.x demo

## Features

- **Products**: Browse and manage product catalog
- **Reviews**: Product review system with ratings
- **Inventory**: Real-time inventory management
- **Checkout**: Order processing with stock validation
- **Error Monitoring**: Sentry integration for error tracking
- **CORS Support**: Cross-origin resource sharing for API access

## Architecture

### Extracted Business Logic (from Laravel 8.x)

**Original Messy Code** ‚ùå:
```php
// All business logic mixed in routes/web.php
Route::get('/products', function () {
    // 40+ lines of nested loops and manual joins
});
```

**Modern Clean Code** ‚úÖ:
```php
// Proper separation of concerns
class ProductController {
    public function index(): JsonResponse {
        return response()->json(
            Product::with('reviews')->get()
        );
    }
}
```

### Service Layer
- **OrderService**: Inventory checking, order processing
- **Dependency Injection**: Controllers receive services via constructor
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints throughout Laravel 12.x

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Status |
|--------|----------|-------------|--------|
| GET | `/api/products` | List all products with reviews | ‚úÖ |
| POST | `/api/checkout` | Process order and validate inventory | ‚úÖ |
| GET | `/api/inventory` | Get current inventory levels | ‚úÖ |
| GET | `/api/handled` | Test handled exception | ‚úÖ |
| GET | `/api/unhandled` | Test unhandled exception | ‚úÖ |

## Development Process

This project follows **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:

### TDD Cycle Completed ‚úÖ

3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up while maintaining green tests

### Phased Approach
Each phase is:
- ‚úÖ Properly tested
- ‚úÖ Documented 
- ‚úÖ Committed to git
- ‚úÖ Pushed to origin
